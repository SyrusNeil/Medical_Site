            <h1>Diabetes</h1>
            <p>Diabetes mellitus refers to a group of diseases that affect how your body uses blood sugar (glucose).</p>
            <p>Glucose is vital to your health because it's an important source of energy for the cells that make up your muscles and tissues.</p>
            <p>It's also your brain's main source of fuel.</p>
            <h1>Symptoms</h1>
            <p>1.Increased thirst</p>
            <p>2.Frequent urination</p>
            <p>3.Unexplained weight loss</p>
            <p>4.Fatigue</p>
            <p>5.Blurred vision</p>
            <p>6.Extreme hunger</p>
            <p>7.Frequent infections, such as gums or skin infections and vaginal infections</p>
            <h1>Risk Factors</h1>
            <p>Risk factors for Diabetes include:</p>
            <p>1.Age. Your risk increases as you get older. This may be because you tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as you age.</p>
            <p>2.Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has diabetes.</p>
            <p>3.Weight. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin.</p>

            <p>5.Abnormal cholesterol. If you have low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or "good," cholesterol, your risk of diabetes is higher.</p>
