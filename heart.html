            <h1>Heart Attack</h1>
            <p>
                Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Heart diseases include:</p>

<p>1.Blood vessel disease, such as coronary artery disease</p>
<p>2.Heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias)</p>
<p>3.Heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects)</p>
<p>4.Heart valve disease</p>
<p>5.Disease of the heart muscle</p>
<p>6.Heart infection</p>
<p>Many forms of heart disease can be prevented or treated with healthy lifestyle choices.
            </p>
            <h1>Symptoms</h1>
            <p>1.Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina)</p>
            <p>2.Shortness of breath</p>
            <p>3.Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in your legs or arms if the blood vessels in those parts of your body are narrowed</p>
            <p>4.Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back</p>
            <h1>Risk Factors</h1>
            <p>Risk factors for developing heart disease include:</p>
            <p>1.Age. Growing older increases your risk of damaged and narrowed arteries and a weakened or thickened heart muscle.</p>
            <p>2.Sex. Men are generally at greater risk of heart disease. The risk for women increases after menopause.</p>
            <p>3.Family history. A family history of heart disease increases your risk of coronary artery disease, especially if a parent developed it at an early age (before age 55 for a male relative, such as your brother or father, and 65 for a female relative, such as your mother or sister).</p>
            <p>4.Smoking. Nicotine tightens your blood vessels, and carbon monoxide can damage their inner lining, making them more susceptible to atherosclerosis. Heart attacks are more common in smokers than in nonsmokers.</p>
            <p>5.Poor diet. A diet that's high in fat, salt, sugar and cholesterol can contribute to the development of heart disease.</p>
            <p>6.High blood pressure. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can result in hardening and thickening of your arteries, narrowing the vessels through which blood flows.</p>
            <p>7.High blood cholesterol levels. High levels of cholesterol in your blood can increase the risk of plaque formation and atherosclerosis.</p>
            <p>8.Diabetes. Diabetes increases your risk of heart disease. Both conditions share similar risk factors, such as obesity and high blood pressure.</p>
            <p>9.Obesity. Excess weight typically worsens other heart disease risk factors.</p>
            <p>10.Physical inactivity. Lack of exercise also is associated with many forms of heart disease and some of its other risk factors as well.
            <p>11.Stress. Unrelieved stress may damage your arteries and worsen other risk factors for heart disease.</p>
            <p>12.Poor dental health. It's important to brush and floss your teeth and gums often, and have regular dental checkups. If your teeth and gums aren't healthy, germs can enter your bloodstream and travel to your heart, causing endocarditis.</p>
            <h1>Prevention</h1>
            <p>Certain types of heart disease, such as heart defects, can't be prevented. However, the same lifestyle changes that can improve your heart disease can help you prevent it, including:</p>

            <p>1.Don't smoke.
            <p>2.Control other health conditions, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.</p>
            <p>3.Exercise at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week.</p>
            <p>4.Eat a diet that's low in salt and saturated fat.</p>
            <p>5.Maintain a healthy weight.</p>
            <p>6.Reduce and manage stress.</p>
            <p>7.Practice good hygiene.</p>
